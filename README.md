# Control4 Experience buttons
This uses the default system provided UIButton proxy driver to create buttons (without controls) in the App/Remote.

This is desirable since the alternative is to use something that wraps the dvd proxy and it shows the dvd controls (the red/blue/yellow/green buttons) by default, despite none of them being configured.
